# Star Wars RPG

## Description
I had a little bit of fun building this basic RPG style game. I was experimenting with building classes, and made a class for the characters that was self building that could be used to make character objects within the game. By doing so, I wrote the entire program in JavaScript rather than adding any HTML directly into the document (aside from a body tag and the script calls). While this isn't really how I would do it for any development project (at least not to this degree), I found it a useful exercise to build my comfort level with JavaScript and my ability to dynamically update webpages. I also took a modified version of the class I created here and implemented it in my portfolio. There are certainly some functions that could be made cleaner and shortened down, and I would be happy for any feedback in that realm. Additionally, I would be curious about people's opinions regarding the efficiency of this type of coding and any applications they personally have used it in. 

## Languages and Frameworks Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* Jquery

## Instructions
Welcome to Star Wars RPG. In this game you will choose one of the characters to play as. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses, so you must pick carefully. The power of attacks and counter attacks vary each time, but there is a small range that you can use to build your strategy. As your character defeats more enemies, their power grows. But be careful - there is no way for your character to recover their health! Once you choose your character, you will pick your first opopnent. To win the game, defeat all of your opponents. Good luck, and may the force be with you!

## Support
If you come across any bugs or have any suggestions to improve the code, please feel free to comment! I would love to improve the code and as this is my first forray into slightly more complex javaScript manipulations, I would love any and all constructive feedback. 

## Project Status
This project is part of a web development program I am currently enrolled in and is in the works. I will continue to improve upon it over the next few months. The user experience in this one in particular could use work. The visual feedback they receive could be improved and I would like to handle winning each individual battle in a different way.
